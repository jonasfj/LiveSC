<p>JTLV_IDE/core - edu.wis.jtlv.env.core<br>
1.edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.fds : a package for all FDS format related
classes.<br>
2. edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.smv : a package for all SMV format related
classes.<br>
2a. edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.smv.eval : a package responsible for the
statement evaluation.<br>
2a(i) edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.smv.eval.temporals : a package which does
nothing (no need to go into that, only through exceptions for declaring
temporal operators from within SMV code)<br>
2b. edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.smv.schema : a package responsible for the
structure construction.<br>
</p>
<p>You can see, that under the main package "edu.wis.jtlv.env.core",
I have created two separated packages for each format, fds and smv. Each
to handle each of the formats. Both fds and smv parsing process works
the same. There are 4 parsing stages.<br>
a. lexer.<br>
b. parsing.<br>
c. variable declaration tree walker.<br>
d. statement declaration tree walker.</p>
<p>In package "edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.fds" you can see:<br>
a. FDSLexer.java - The automatically generated lexer from file FDS.g in
JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
b. FDSParser.java - The automatically generated parser from file FDS.g
in JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
c. FDSVarWalker.java - The automatically generated tree walker from file
FDSVarWalker.g in JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
d. FDSStmtWalker.java - The automatically generated tree walker from
file FDSStmtWalker.g in JTLV_PARESERS.</p>
<p>These files exactly correspond to the four stages of processing.
The same goes to the "edu.wis.jtlv.env.core.smv" package:<br>
a. SMVLexer.java - The automatically generated lexer from file SMV.g in
JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
b. SMVParser.java - The automatically generated parser from file SMV.g
in JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
c. SMVVarWalker.java - The automatically generated tree walker from file
SMVVarWalker.g in JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
d. SMVStmtWalker.java - The automatically generated tree walker from
file SMVStmtWalker.g in JTLV_PARESERS.<br>
</p>
<p>The only difference is that since SMV is a much more complex
syntax, and I didn't want to start java programming through ANTLRWorks,
I have created a static API. StructuralInit.java is the API for
SMVVarWalker.java / SMVParser.java (and SMVVarWalker.g / SMV.g) to use.
And StmtInit.java is the API for SMVStmtWalker.java (and
SMVStmtWalker.g) to use. Both APIs exploit the other sub packages, and
construct the SMVModule object.</p>
<p>I still have a design dilemma whether SMVModule.java should be a
part of the JTLV_IDE/core or a part of the JTLV_IDE/api. I would prefer
it if the JTLV_IDE/core will be encapsulated, and won't have any
dependencies on any other component. From that hand it would be
reasonable to put it in the JTLV_IDE/core. From the other hand
SMVModule.java is the basic object to end users, and I want it also to
be a user object. For now it is at the JTLV_IDE/api component. So, the
only dependency that the JTLV_IDE/core package currently has on external
component is SMVModule.java at the JTLV_IDE/api component.</p>

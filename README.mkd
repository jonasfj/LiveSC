LiveSC: A Live Sequence Chart Editor
====================================
LiveSC is web-based live sequence chart editor that can check for realizability, given a set of charts with environment and system instance lines.

Realizability is checking using symbolic model checking with JTLV running as a Java applet. This currently causes LiveSC to be fairly slow, and due to the poor integration of Java in modern browsers occationally requires the user to kill a few process.

In its current state the code is still fairly unpolished, and this merly serves as a proof of concept. An online test version of LiveSC can be found [here](http://jopsen.github.com/LiveSC/).


Building LiveSC
---------------
LiveSC is written in coffeescript, and a `Cakefile` for building can be located in the repository root.

To build the applet you'll need a Scala compiler, Java compiler and GNU Make.
The relevant `makefile` can be located in the `applet/` folder of the repository.
